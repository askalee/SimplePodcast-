# SimplePodcast Web Player

This project aims to build an offline-first podcast player that runs entirely in the browser. The first user story focuses on allowing users to subscribe to podcast feeds by entering an RSS URL or selecting from a recommended list.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `app` folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The subscription list is stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`.
